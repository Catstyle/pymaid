'''pymaid separate network into two layer

- transport layer
    transport layer concern about how data transmit
    for example: stream for tcp; packet for udp
    and security of transmission: with or without ssl/tls

- protocol layer
    protocol layer concern about how app data format
    it does not care where the data comes from
    stream, packet, file, or pipeline are not different

    you feed it data, and it gives you protocol messages, that's all

    for example: http, protocol buffer, websocket
    and also has the ability to wrap builtin Protocols
    like AppProtocol(PBProtocol) or even AppProtocol(PBProtocol(WSProtocol))
